## Run the program

Run from the command line:

```
python3 main.py
```

The `main.py` script runs the main menu, which gives access to all functions of the program. The constants file allows us to change the constants of the game and thus, change the difficulty of the game.


To play the game press the start button. The player has to jump by clicking space to avoid the obstacles on the ground (rocks and cats). Moreover, the player can throw shurikens by clicking on the left button of the mouse to eliminate the arrows of the ennemies comming from the top of the screen. If any obstacle touches the player once, the game is over. The game is a runner, so it's infinite.
